"# building-data-directory"
This is the program file of the Building Data Genome Directory, a comprehensive building dataset collection, where you can find the links for the datasets related with building energy research.
The files with the suffix of ".py" are built for the streamlit webpage, the "META_DIRECTORY.py" is the main page (i.e., the meta directory). Other files in the folder "pages" are for the sub-pages of the streamlit api.
The “Procfile” file is the instruction for running the main page. If there is any change on the main page program file name, remember to make revision on that.
If any new library is imported, please note to add "lirary_name == version" (e.g., "plotly == 5.10.0") in the "requirements.txt" file.
The media files required on the API website ("meta directory.png", "browsing.gif"), history codes and tables ("history codes", "previous lists") are also stored in this repository.
